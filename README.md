How to use the die!?

Die D-69/70 That helps selecting lottery ticket numbers for Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries.

For Powerball ticket numbers: Roll the die 5 times first for selecting the 5 different numbers 1 to 69.
Then, roll the die for getting the 1 Powerball number. Roll until a number from 1 to 26 comes out. 

Re-roll the die in case a certain number is repeated.
ignore the number 70 if rolled (simply re-roll the die).

For Mega Millions ticket numbers: 
Roll the die 5 times first for selecting the 5 different numbers 1 to 70. Then roll the die for getting the 1 number of Gold Mega Ball. Roll until a number from 1 to 25 comes out. 

Re-roll the die in case a certain number is repeated.

Good luck :)
